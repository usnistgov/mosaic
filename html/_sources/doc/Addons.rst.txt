Addons
=================================


The output of |projname| is often processed further to generate plots or performe more sophisticated analysis. We facilitate this process by providing addon packages that make it easy to import the SQLite_ database generated by a |projname| analysis into :ref:`mathematica-addons-sec`, :ref:`matlab-addons-sec` or :ref:`igor-addons-sec`. The interfaces for these programs are described in more detail in this section.
