Threshold can be thought of, very roughly, as proportional to the length of time a subevent must be sustained for it to be detected. The algorithm will adjust the actual threshold used on a per&#45;event basis in order to minimize false positive detection of current jumps This algorithm is based on code used in OpenNanopore, which you can read about here: http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/NR/c2nr30951c#!divAbstract" alt="" coords="324,55,480,80"/>
