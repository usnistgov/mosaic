Scripting and Advanced Features
=================================


The analysis can be run from the command line by setting up a Python_ script. Scripting allows one to build additional analysis tools on top of |projname|. The first step is to import |projname| as shown below.


.. sourcecode:: python

    import mosaic

Alternatively, one can import sub-modules of |projname| directly into a script to access other parts of the system as shown below.

.. sourcecode:: python

    import mosaic.qdfTrajIO as qdf
    import mosaic.abfTrajIO as abf
    
    import mosaic.SingleChannelAnalysis
    import mosaic.eventSegment as es
    import mosaic.adept2State 
    import mosaic.besselLowpassFilter as bessel


Import Data and Run an Analysis
---------------------------------------------


Once the required modules are imported, a basic analysis can be run with the code snippet below. The top-level object that is used to configure and run a new analysis is :py:class:`~mosaic.SingleChannelAnalysis.SingleChannelAnalysis`, which takes five arguments: i) the path to the data directory, ii) a handle to a *TrajIO* object that reads in data (e.g. :py:class:`~mosaic.abfTrajIO.abfTrajIO`), iii) a handle to a data filtering algorithm (e.g. :py:class:`~mosaic.besselLowpassFilter.besselLowpassFilter` or `None` for no filtering), iv) a handle to a partitioning algorithm (e.g. :py:class:`~mosaic.eventSegment.eventSegment`) that partitions the data and v) a handle to a processing algorithm (e.g. :py:class:`~mosaic.adept2State.adept2State`) that processes individual blockade events.



.. sourcecode:: python

    # Process all ABF files in a directory
    analysisObj=mosaic.SingleChannelAnalysis.SingleChannelAnalysis(
                '~/ReferenceData/abfSet1',
                abf.abfTrajIO,
                None,
                es.eventSegment,
                moasaic.adept2State.adept2State
            )

The analysis is started by calling the `Run()` function.

.. sourcecode:: python

    analysisObj.Run()


The code listing above analyzes all ABF files in the specified directory. Handles to trajectory I/O, data filtering, event partitioning and event processing are controlled with their corresponding sections in the :ref:`settings-page`. Default settings used to read ABF files are shown below.

.. sourcecode:: javascript
    
    "abfTrajIO" : {
        "filter"            : "*.abf", 
        "start"             : 0.0, 
        "dcOffset"          : 0.0
    }

|projname| also supports the QUB QDF file format used by the `Electronic Biosciences`_ Nanopatch system. This is accomplished by replacing :py:class:`~mosaic.abfTrajIO.abfTrajIO` in the previous example with :py:class:`~mosaic.qdfTrajIO.qdfTrajIO`.  Settings for QDF files require two additional parameters to be specified in the settings file, the feedback resistance (Rfb) in Ohms and capacitance (Cfb) in Farads as described in the :ref:`api-docs-page`. A sample section of the settings file to read QDF files, followed by Python code required to run an anlysis, is shown below.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    "qdfTrajIO": {
            "Rfb"               : 9.1e+12, 
            "Cfb"               : 1.07e-12, 
            "dcOffset"          : 0.0, 
            "filter"            : "*.qdf", 
            "start"             : 0.0
        }


.. sourcecode:: python

    # Process all QDF files in a directory
    mosaic.SingleChannelAnalysis.SingleChannelAnalysis(
                '~/ReferenceData/qdfSet1',
                qdf.qdfTrajIO,
                None,
                es.eventSegment,
                mosaic.adept2State.adept2State
            ).Run() 



Upon completion the analysis writes a log file to the directory containing the data. The log file summarizes the conditions under which the analysis were run, the settings used and timing information.

Filter Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. sourcecode:: python

    # Filter data with a Bessel filter before processing
    mosaic.SingleChannelAnalysis.SingleChannelAnalysis(
                '~/ReferenceData/abfSet1',
                abf.abfTrajIO,
                bessel.besselLowpassFilter, 
                es.eventSegment,
                mosaic.adept2State.adept2State
            ).Run()

|projname| supports filtering data prior to analysis. This is achieved by passing the `dataFilterHnd` argument to the :py:class:`~mosaic.SingleChannelAnalysis.SingleChannelAnalysis` object. In the code above, the ABF data is filtered using a :py:class:`~mosaic.besselLowpassFilter.besselLowpassFilter`. Parameters for the filter are defined within the settings file as described in the :ref:`settings-page` section.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    "besselLowpassFilter" : {
        "filterOrder"    : "6",
        "filterCutoff"   : "10000",
        "decimate"       : "1"   
    }

A similar approach can be used to filter data using a :py:class:`~mosaic.waveletDenoiseFilter.waveletDenoiseFilter` or a tap delay line (:py:class:`~mosaic.convolutionFilter.convolutionFilter`). Additional filters can be easily added to |projname| as described in :ref:`extend-page`.

Advanced Scripting
---------------------------------------------

Scripting with Python_ allows transforming the output of the |projname| further to generate plots, perform additional analysis or extend functionality. Moreover, individual components of the |projname| module, which forms the back end code executed in the data processing pipeline, can be used for specific tasks. In this section, we highlight a few typical use cases. 

**Plot the Ionic Current Time-Series**

    .. sourcecode:: python
    
        import mosaic.abfTrajIO as abf
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        
        abfDat=abf.abfTrajIO(dirname='~/abfSet1/', filter='*.abf')
        plt.plot( np.arange(0,1,1/500000.), b.popdata(500000), 'b.', markersize=2 )
        plt.xlabel("t (s)", fontsize=14)
        plt.ylabel("-i (pA)", fontsize=14)
        plt.show()



It is useful to visualize time-series data to highlight unique characteristics of a sample. For example the sample code above was used to load 1 second of monodisperse PEG28 data, sampled at 500 kHz. The data was read using a :py:class:`~mosaic.abfTrajIO.abfTrajIO` object similar to the examples above. The :py:meth:`~mosaic.metaTrajIO.metaTrajIO.popdata` command was used to take 500k data points (or 1 second) and then plot a time-series using matplotlib_ (see figure below). Calling :py:meth:`~mosaic.metaTrajIO.metaTrajIO.popdata` again will return the next *n* points.

We have packaged time-series plotting into an easy to use module :py:class:`~mosaicscripts.plots.timeseries`. Run interactive examples in an IPython notebook: |timeseries|


**Estimate the Channel Gating Duration**

Scripting can be used to obtain statistics from the raw time-series. In the code snippet below, we estimate the amount of time a channel spends in a gated state by combining modules defined within |projname|. The analysis is performed in blocks for efficiency. We first define a Python function that takes multiple arguments including  *TrajIO* object, the threshold at which we want to define the gated state in pA (gatingcurrentpa), the block size in seconds (blocksz), the total time of the time-series being processed in seconds (totaltime) and the sampling rate of the data in Hz (fshz). The function then calculates the number of blocks in which the channel was in a gated state and returns the time spent in that state in seconds.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        import mosaic.abfTrajIO as abf
        import numpy as np

        def estimateGatingDuration( trajioobj, gatingcurrentpa, blocksz, totaltime, fshz ):
            npts = int((fshz)*blocksz)
            nblk = int(totaltime/blocksz)-1

            # Iterate over the blocks of data and check if the channel was in a gated state.
            # The code below returns the mean ionic current of blocks that are below the gating
            # threshold (gatingcurrentpa)
            gEvents = filter(  lambda x:x<float(gatingcurrentpa), 
                               [ np.mean(trajioobj.popdata(npts)) for i in range(nblk) ])

            return len(gEvents)*blocksz

        abfObj=abf.abfTrajIO(dirname='~/abfSet1',filter='*.abf')
        print estimateGatingDuration( abfObj, 20., 0.25, 100, abfObj.FsHz )


**Plot the Output of an Analysis**

This final example shows how one can use |projname| to process an ionic current time-series and then build a custom script that further analyses and plots the results. This example uses single-molecule mass spectrometry (SMMS) data :cite:`Robertson:2007jo`, described in more detail in the :ref:`smms-sec` section .

In the code below, we first process all the ABF files in a specified directory similar to the examples in previous sections. Upon completion of the analysis, the results are stored in a SQLite_ database, which can be then queried using the structured query language (SQL_).

        s.openDB(glob.glob("~/ReferenceData/abfSet1/*sqlite")[-1])
        
        # We first set up a string that holds the query to retrieve the analysis results. Note that {col} 
        # will be replaced with the name of the database column when we run the query below.
        q = "select {col} from metadata where ProcessingStatus='normal' and ResTime > 0.2 \
             and BlockDepth between 0.15 and 0.55"

        # Now we run two separate queries - the first returns the blockade depth
        # and the second returns the residence time. Note that we simply take the query
        # string 'q' above and replace {col} with the column name.
        x=np.hstack( s.queryDB( q.format(col='BlockDepth') ) )
        y=np.hstack( s.queryDB( q.format(col='ResTime') ) )
        
        # Use matplotlib to plot the results with 2 views: 
        # i)  a 1D histogram of blockade depths and
        # ii) a 2D histogram of the residence times vs. blockade depth
        fig = pl.gcf()
        fig.canvas.set_window_title('Residence Time vs. Blockade Depth')
        
        pl.subplot(2, 1, 1)
        pl.hist(x, bins=500, histtype='step', rwidth=0.1)
        pl.xticks(())
        pl.ylabel("Counts", fontsize=14)
        
        pl.subplot(2, 1, 2)
        pl.hist2d(x,y, bins=500)
        
        pl.xlabel("Blockade Depth", fontsize=14)
        pl.ylabel("Residence Time (ms)", fontsize=14)
        pl.ylim([0.2, 20])
        
        pl.show()


Running the code above generates a two pane plot using matplotlib_. The top pane contains a histogram of the blockade depth, while the bottom pane plots a 2D histogram of residence time vs. blockade depth.
